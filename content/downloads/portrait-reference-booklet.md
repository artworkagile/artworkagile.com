title: "Portrait Reference Booklet"
description: "A collection of cinematic faces for sketching practice. The portraits in this booklet come from old movies now in the public domain. I downloaded those films, went through them frame by frame, and picked moments where faces were clear and expressive. Each image was gently enhanced to restore a bit of contrast and life lost over time. From there, I chose the ones I liked most — simple, well-lit scenes that are easy to draw from. This booklet is meant for practice, not perfection. Just faces worth sketching."
