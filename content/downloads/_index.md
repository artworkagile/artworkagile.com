Below, you can find printable pages that help me to experiment with different paints, pigments, and colors. I've built these pages as A4-sized printable sheets. If you're using water-based paint, I recommend using thicker paper, and any artistic paper will work for dry mediums. Notice that your printer might not be able to process paper that is too thick.
