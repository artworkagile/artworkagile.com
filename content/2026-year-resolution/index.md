title: "Sustained Capacity: My 2026 Resolution"

description: "My resolution for 2026 focuses on maintaining my health, knowledge, and recognition without burning out."

I entered 2025 as a meteor enters Earth’s atmosphere. And 2025 has burnt me.
In 2026, I will take what’s left and try to recover. I have to act conservatively, trying to finish what is doable.
To increase the chances of accomplishing this, I will advertise a few promises:

*Health*: I will manage my sleep and aim to get at least 7.5 hours per day on average. My sleep schedule will appear on this blog, and I will update it with graphs monthly. I have already set up a reminder for myself to do it every month.

*Knowledge*: I will keep learning something new. And to be accountable, I will promise that I will finish “The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy”, a book by Chris Bailey. And “Building a second brain” by Tiago Forte. I will keep you posted about the progress.

*Recognition*: I plan to write a couple of essays and post them on my Substack. The first one: “Why did I stop using Anki?”, and “A positive critique of the Year Compass”.

This resolution is intentionally modest and if I can stay rested but visible without burning out, the year succeeds.
