    <h2>Sustained Capacity: My 2026 Resolution</h2>
    
    <p class="post-meta">2026-01-04</p>
    
    <p>I entered 2025 as a meteor enters Earth’s atmosphere. And 2025 has burnt me.
In 2026, I will take what’s left and try to recover. I have to act conservatively, trying to finish what is doable.
To increase the chances of accomplishing this, I will advertise a few promises:</p>
<p><em>Health</em>: I will manage my sleep and aim to get at least 7.5 hours per day on average. My sleep schedule will appear on this blog, and I will update it with graphs monthly. I have already set up a reminder for myself to do it every month.</p>
<p><em>Knowledge</em>: I will keep learning something new. And to be accountable, I will promise that I will finish “The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy”, a book by Chris Bailey. And “Building a second brain” by Tiago Forte. I will keep you posted about the progress.</p>
<p><em>Recognition</em>: I plan to write a couple of essays and post them on my Substack. The first one: “Why did I stop using Anki?”, and “A positive critique of the Year Compass”.</p>
<p>This resolution is intentionally modest. It does not aim to reinvent, accelerate, or transform. It aims at continuity. If I can stay rested, curious, and visible without burning out, the year succeeds.</p>
<p>If I break these promises, the graphs will show it. If I keep them, there will be time later for expansion.</p>
<p>2026 is not about proving capacity.
It is about preserving it.</p>
