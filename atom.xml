        <content type="html" xml:base="https://artworkagile.com/2026-year-resolution/">&lt;p&gt;I entered 2025 as a meteor enters Earth’s atmosphere. And 2025 has burnt me.
In 2026, I will take what’s left and try to recover. I have to act conservatively, trying to finish what is doable.
To increase the chances of accomplishing this, I will advertise a few promises:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: I will manage my sleep and aim to get at least 7.5 hours per day on average. My sleep schedule will appear on this blog, and I will update it with graphs monthly. I have already set up a reminder for myself to do it every month.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowledge&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: I will keep learning something new. And to be accountable, I will promise that I will finish “The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy”, a book by Chris Bailey. And “Building a second brain” by Tiago Forte. I will keep you posted about the progress.

&lt;em&gt;Recognition&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: I plan to write a couple of essays and post them on my Substack. The first one: “Why did I stop using Anki?”, and “A positive critique of the Year Compass”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resolution is intentionally modest and if I can stay rested but visible without burning out, the year succeeds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
