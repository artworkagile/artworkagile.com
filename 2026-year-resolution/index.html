<h1>Sustained Capacity: My 2026 Resolution</h1>



<p>I entered 2025 as a meteor enters Earth’s atmosphere. And 2025 has burnt me.
In 2026, I will take what’s left and try to recover. I have to act conservatively, trying to finish what is doable.
To increase the chances of accomplishing this, I will advertise a few promises:</p>
<p><em>Health</em>: I will manage my sleep and aim to get at least 7.5 hours per day on average. My sleep schedule will appear on this blog, and I will update it with graphs monthly. I have already set up a reminder for myself to do it every month.</p>
<p><em>Knowledge</em>: I will keep learning something new. And to be accountable, I will promise that I will finish “The Productivity Project: Accomplishing More by Managing Your Time, Attention, and Energy”, a book by Chris Bailey. And “Building a second brain” by Tiago Forte. I will keep you posted about the progress.
4
<em>Recognition</em>: I plan to write a couple of essays and post them on my Substack. The first one: “Why did I stop using Anki?”, and “A positive critique of the Year Compass”.</p>
<p>This resolution is intentionally modest and if I can stay rested but visible without burning out, the year succeeds.</p>
